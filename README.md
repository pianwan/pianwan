### Hi there 👋

I'm currently an MS in Computer Science student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). Before moving to the United States, I gained industry experience through internships at leading tech company in China. At [WeChat Tencent](https://www.wechat.com/), I worked as a Software Engineer Intern on the recommendation system backend for WeChat Channels short videos. I also interned at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US), where I contributed to building robust data processing backend. In the USA, I worked as an SDE Intern at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.com/), focusing on automated OS security patching. Additionally, I worked at [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/) global CDN team.

In academia, my research focus on 3D Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics. For publications, click [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O2EzHBQAAAAJ) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-9368-3662).

I am currently seeking entry-level Software Development Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer positions in the USA.
