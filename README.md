### Hi there 👋

I'm a first-year MS in Computer Science student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), focusing on the development of highly reliable systems for large-scale machine learning pipelines and data platforms. Previously, I worked at [WeChat Tencent (#1 App for everything in China)](https://www.wechat.com/) as a Software Engineer, developing recommendation systems backend for WeChat Channels short videos. I also interned at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US), where I contributed to building robust data platforms for enterprise-level data processing. 



My interests also extend to Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Video Game Development. I have a publication on 3D reconstruction in ECCV 2024.



I am currently seeking SDE/MLE internship or co-op opportunities in the United States.

🌏🌎🌍 I have traveled to 🇨🇳🇯🇵🇰🇷🇨🇭🇺🇸🇫🇷🇪🇬🇦🇪...

🏫📚💻 I have studied at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) & [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).

Having studied at the world's leading science and technology institutes in the United States, Europe, and China, I have a broad perspective that helps me approach problems and work with people from different backgrounds. These experiences have made me adaptable, open to new ideas, and better at communicating with others.
