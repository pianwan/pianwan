### Hi there 👋

I'm a first-year MSCS student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), focusing on the development of highly reliable systems for large-scale machine learning pipelines and data platforms. Previously, I worked at [WeChat Tencent](https://www.wechat.com/), focusing on backend development for recommendation systems in WeChat Channels short videos. I also interned as a Software Engineer at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US), where I contributed to building robust data platforms for enterprise-level data processing. 



My interests also extend to Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Video Game Development. I have a publication on 3D reconstruction in ECCV 2024.



I am currently seeking SDE/MLE internship or co-op opportunities in the United States.
